Random place to scrawl stuff:

- Examiners at transfer report suggested cumulative distribution function graphs instead of boxplots. They are right. Would be better to show the distributions. Haven't done it yet.

- Suggested that need to sign-post my transfer report better. More reminders of why people care about stuff.

- Could remove stuff from lit review. It's pretty long.

- COuld include a section on visualisations

- Need to make clear that I'm developing a tool to enable invstigation of missclassifiction. I don't expect to 'solve' it.
