Chapter Four: Visualising Londonâ€™s travel & exposure

In addition to population level exposure estimates for epidemiological studies, the Hybrid Exposure model has the potential to be a tool for public health education and policy development. In order to realise this, a graphical front end is required to demonstrate its application and use. This Chapter will visualise the findings of the previous two chapters and investigate their usefulness in encouraging behavioural change. Think that this is where the engagement with the public comes in probably + feedback from them.

These visualisations would be completed using D3 and/or Processing and/or Leaflet. Online web maps, videos, fancy graphics. Lots of possibilities here.
