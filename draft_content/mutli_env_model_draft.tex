 Adams. Fine particulate (PM2.5) personal exposure levels in transport microenvironments, London, UK. \cite{Adams2001}. 1) 465 journeys and 61 volunteers, 3 weeks in the summer and 3 weeks in the winter. 2) Three fixed routes at peak and off peak times of the day. 3) Summer mean exposure was 34.5 for bicycle, 39 for for bus, 37.7 for car, and 247 for tube. 4) Winter mean exposure was 23.5 for bicycle, 33.7 for bus, 38.9 for car, 157.3 for tube. 5) Significant variation between routes . 6) Mean personal exposure levels in road transport were approximately double that of the concentration at an urban background fixed montior site.
 
"Outdoor concentrations (mean, 42 ug/m3) exceeded indoor concentrations (mean, 35 ug/m3) but underestimated personal exposures (mean, 62 ug/m3). The major part of the difference between personal and outdoor concentrations could be attributed to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, living along a busy road, and time spent in a vehicle. The results show a reasonably high correlation between personal and outdoor PM10 within individuals, providing support for the use of ambient PM10 concentrations as a measure of exposure in epidemiologic studies linking the day-to-day variation in particulate matter air pollution to the day-to-day variation in health endpoints." from \cite{Janssen1998}.
