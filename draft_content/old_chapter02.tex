Chapter Two: Population exposure misclassification using a Hybrid exposure model

Outputted data from model will be for 90,000 people. Work on scaling this to population level. Compare monitoring site nearest postcode pollution exposure estimate to 24 hours at home postcode exposure estimate, then dynamic exposure estimate calculations. Each estimate would be made using the TRAFFIC Hybrid Exposure model. Making outputs (mostly maps) from this data and quantifying patterns and points of interest. Categories of comparison will be data such as geographical location, socio-economic grade, employment status, age, gender, ethnicity etc. Perhaps adopt a matrix approach of pollutants down the X axis and population characteristics along the Y. Focus on traffic related pollutants. Finally scale up to population of London.
